For the last 5 years I have worked as a Product Manager for a number of products and internal projects in rapidly expanding startups within the tech food industry in the US. Leading projects ranging from POS and enterprise configuration to 3rd party API integrations, data warehousing, and managing data annotation pipelines for ML. I have experience in developing yearly product roadmaps that meet company and investors' goals and requirements from a variety of customers with very different use cases. I am skilled in further breaking down the roadmap goals into deliverable User Stories that are implemented by the development team. I also have experience producing public system documentation and release notes.
